## PyJava 

This library is designed for Java/Scala invoking python code using Apache 
Arrow as the exchanging data format. This means if you want to run some python code 
in Scala/Java, the Scala/Java will start some python workers automatically,
then send the data/code to python worker in socket and the python workers process the data with user-provided python code 
finally return back. 

The initial code in this lib is from Apache Spark.


## Used In Spark
